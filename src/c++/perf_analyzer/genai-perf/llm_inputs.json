Respondents express concern regarding potential manipulation of content they consume online.  People believe it is essential that they have the tools to verify the trustworthiness of online content.  SAN JOSE, Calif. – Apr. 18, 2024 – Today, Adobe (Nasdaq: ADBE) released findings of its inaugural Future of Trust Study, which surveyed over 6,000 consumers across the U.S., U.K., France and Germany about their experience encountering misinformation online and concerns about the impact of generative AI. Tied to its work on Responsible Innovation, Adobe commissioned the study to understand public perceptions and sentiment about the societal impact of generative AI and misinformation, including its implications within the context of global elections this year. Among the findings, the study highlights strong desire from consumers to have tools to verify the trustworthiness of digital content and the urgent need for proactive measures to address misinformation’s potential impact on election integrity globally.  'We are all excited about the power of generative AI to transform creativity and productivity,' said Dana Rao, executive vice president, General Counsel and Chief Trust Officer, Adobe. 'As a leader in commercially deploying AI technology, we have long considered its implication in society. As the results of this study clearly show, it is critical that we educate consumers about the dangers of deepfakes and provide them with tools to understand what is true. With elections coming, now is the time to adopt protective technologies like Content Credentials to help restore trust in the digital content we are consuming.' Key findings of the study include: Misinformation is regarded as one of the biggest threats facing society - a concern that may be eroding trust in certain platforms where misinformation is spread.  With misinformation becoming more prevalent, the study shows that most respondents (84% U.S., 85% U.K., 84% France, 80% Germany) express concern that the content they consume online is vulnerable to being altered to fuel misinformation.  A significant number of consumers (70% U.S., 76% U.K., 73% France, 70% Germany) said that it is becoming difficult to verify whether the content they are consuming online is trustworthy.  Concerns about misinformation are also impacting consumer’s use of social media platforms with some respondents (39% U.S., 29% U.K., 37% France, 24% Germany) saying that they have stopped or curtailed their use of a specific social media platform due to the amount of misinformation on it.  Amidst a climate of eroding trust in digital content, consumers are concerned about protecting election integrity.  In a year when over four billion people globally are expected to head to the polls, the study found that a significant number of people (80% U.S., 78% U.K., 67% France, 70% Germany) believe that misinformation and harmful deepfakes will impact future elections. Without widespread tools to help them decide whether the online content they are consuming is true, a significant number of people (78% U.S., 83% U.K., 78% France, 72% Germany) believe that election candidates should be prohibited from using generative AI in their promotional content. Most consumers (83% U.S., 88% U.K., 84% France, 79% Germany) believe that governments and technology companies should work together to protect election integrity against the detrimental effects of deepfakes and misinformation.\n# OUTPUT",
